You'll learn how to configure KEDA scalers, how to integrate various event sources, and how to visualize the autoscaling process in a complex microservices architecture. This challenge will deepen your understanding of event-driven autoscaling in cloud-native environments and showcase how KEDA enhances Kubernetes' native scaling capabilities","order":null,"banner":"https://cloud.layer5.io/academy/","permalink":"https://cloud.layer5.io/academy/challenges/11111111-1111-1111-1111-111111111111/cncf-auto-scaling-challenge/autoscaling-with-keda/content/description/"},{"title":"FAQs","description":"","order":null,"banner":"https://cloud.layer5.io/academy/","permalink":"https://cloud.layer5.io/academy/challenges/11111111-1111-1111-1111-111111111111/cncf-auto-scaling-challenge/autoscaling-with-keda/content/faq/"}]}]}
