&lt;p>Many people have a complex job building, testing, and running systems based on old concepts and technology in today&amp;rsquo;s IT — the results you can see below (Experiences we want to change!). Modern ways to build, test, and run IT systems are not adopted as broadly as possible. Hence, a lot of pain is still out there that we could ease by changing IT processes and utilizing the new ways.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>New Ideas &amp; Concepts</title><link>https://cloud.layer5.io/academy/learning-paths/27e21312-1e0c-4b2b-a045-95fcde425f09/example-learning-path/course-1/content/new-ideas-and-concepts/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cloud.layer5.io/academy/learning-paths/27e21312-1e0c-4b2b-a045-95fcde425f09/example-learning-path/course-1/content/new-ideas-and-concepts/</guid><description>&lt;h3 id="new-ideas--concepts">&lt;strong>New Ideas &amp;amp; Concepts&lt;/strong>&lt;a class="td-heading-self-link" href="#new-ideas--concepts" aria-label="Heading self-link">&lt;/a>&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>As often in IT, great &amp;ldquo;new&amp;rdquo; ideas and concepts are recycled or borrowed from others. So it happened that the shipping industry was a big inspiration for optimizing IT infrastructure operations more than two decades ago.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The concept of a container to standardize the packing of goods, make them universal to handle and transport on different means of transportation to improve efficiency and reduce the transportation costs was a real success story for the transportation industry.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Container Benefits</title><link>https://cloud.layer5.io/academy/learning-paths/27e21312-1e0c-4b2b-a045-95fcde425f09/example-learning-path/course-1/content/container-benefits/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cloud.layer5.io/academy/learning-paths/27e21312-1e0c-4b2b-a045-95fcde425f09/example-learning-path/course-1/content/container-benefits/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://cloud.layer5.io/academy/27e21312-1e0c-4b2b-a045-95fcde425f09/image-1.png" alt="image">&lt;/p>

&lt;li>&lt;strong>dev and ops separation of concerns&lt;/strong> create application container images at build/release time rather than deployment time, thereby decoupling applications from infrastructure&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>

&lt;li>&lt;strong>continuous development, integration, and deployment&lt;/strong> provides for reliable and frequent container image build and deployment with quick and efficient rollbacks – due to image immutability&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>

&lt;p>Early on, organizations ran applications on physical servers. There was no way to define resource boundaries for applications in a physical server, and this caused resource allocation issues. For example, if multiple applications run on a physical server, there can be instances where one application would take up most of the resources, and as a result, the other applications would underperform. A solution for this would be to run each application on a different physical server. But this did not scale as resources were underutilized, and it was expensive for organizations to maintain many physical servers.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
