&lt;p>Meshery &lt;a href="https://docs.meshery.io/concepts/logical/designs">Designs&lt;/a> provide a visual blueprint for your infrastructure, showcasing the various components and their relationships. These designs can encompass Kubernetes resources and their relationships, annotations, and the numerous cloud-native and application integrations that Meshery supports.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In this guide, you will learn how to identify these components and gain a clear understanding of their significance within the design.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 class="chapter-sub-heading">Meshery Designs and Models&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Meshery Designs leverage the power and flexibility of Meshery Models as their foundation.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Reviewing Designs</title><link>http://localhost:9876/academy/learning-paths/aabid/mastering-meshery/introduction-to-meshery/reviewing-designs/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://localhost:9876/academy/learning-paths/aabid/mastering-meshery/introduction-to-meshery/reviewing-designs/</guid><description>&lt;div class="chapter-content">

&lt;p>When working with Kanvas’ Designer Mode, collaboration is key. Design reviews allow team members to examine, provide feedback, and approve design proposals, ensuring that all components are thoroughly evaluated and potential issues are identified early. This process leads to more robust designs, informed decision-making, and a unified understanding among team members, ultimately contributing to the success of the project.&lt;/p>
&lt;h1 class="chapter-sub-heading">Lifecycle of Design Reviews&lt;/h1>
&lt;h2 class="chapter-sub-heading">Submitting Designs&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>This initial step involves preparing your design to be reviewed by your peers. Start by submitting your design for review, ensuring all components are accurately placed and configured. It is crucial to double-check that every aspect of the design is ready for feedback. In the context of Kanvas, you can submit designs for review by:&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Creating Designs</title><link>http://localhost:9876/academy/learning-paths/aabid/mastering-meshery/introduction-to-meshery/creating-designs/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://localhost:9876/academy/learning-paths/aabid/mastering-meshery/introduction-to-meshery/creating-designs/</guid><description>&lt;div class="chapter-content">

Meet Alero, an Engineering Manager at Mango company, and two DevOps engineers, Musa and Hargun. Alero&amp;rsquo;s responsibilities include assigning workspaces, teams, and environments, as well as managing access control for Musa and Hargun. Each engineer leads their own team with distinct responsibilities.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The goal here is to show you how Alero can structure their workspaces to streamline collaboration, maintain robust access control, and optimize workflow deployment across these teams. By following along, you&amp;rsquo;ll learn how to set up a similar structure for your own organization.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
