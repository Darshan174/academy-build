Every Pod holds at least one container and controls the execution of that container.","banner":"http://localhost:9876/academy/","permalink":"http://localhost:9876/academy/learning-paths/aabid/aabids-kubernetes-courcew/kubernetes-building-blocks/content/pods/","orgId":"aabid","courses":[]},{"title":"REPLICASETs","description":"ReplicaSets are a fundamental building block in Kubernetes, ensuring that a specified number of identical Pods are running at all times.","banner":"http://localhost:9876/academy/","permalink":"http://localhost:9876/academy/learning-paths/aabid/aabids-kubernetes-courcew/kubernetes-building-blocks/content/replicasets/","orgId":"aabid","courses":[]},{"title":"DEAMONSETs","description":"DaemonSets have many use cases â€“ one frequent pattern is to use DaemonSets to install or configure each host node. DaemonSets provide a way to ensure that a Pod copy is running on every node in the cluster. As a cluster grows and shrinks, the DaemonSet spreads these specially labelled Pods across all nodes.","banner":"http://localhost:9876/academy/","permalink":"http://localhost:9876/academy/learning-paths/aabid/aabids-kubernetes-courcew/kubernetes-building-blocks/content/deamonsets/","orgId":"aabid","courses":[]},{"title":"DEPLOYMENTs","description":"Deployments are a higher-order abstraction that controls deploying and maintaining a set of Pods.
