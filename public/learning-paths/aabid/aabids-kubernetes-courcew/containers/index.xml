 &lt;h2 class="chapter-sub-heading">Why Containers?&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Many people have a complex job building, testing, and running systems based on old concepts and technology in today&amp;rsquo;s IT — the results you can see below (Experiences we want to change!). Modern ways to build, test, and run IT systems are not adopted as broadly as possible. Hence, a lot of pain is still out there that we could ease by changing IT processes and utilizing the new ways.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>New Ideas &amp; Concepts</title><link>https://cloud.layer5.io/academy/learning-paths/aabid/aabids-kubernetes-courcew/containers/content/new-ideas-and-concepts/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cloud.layer5.io/academy/learning-paths/aabid/aabids-kubernetes-courcew/containers/content/new-ideas-and-concepts/</guid><description>&lt;div class="chapter-content">
 &lt;h2 class="chapter-sub-heading">New Ideas &amp; Concepts&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>As often in IT, great &amp;ldquo;new&amp;rdquo; ideas and concepts are recycled or borrowed from others. So it happened that the shipping industry was a big inspiration for optimizing IT infrastructure operations more than two decades ago.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The concept of a container to standardize the packing of goods, make them universal to handle and transport on different means of transportation to improve efficiency and reduce the transportation costs was a real success story for the transportation industry.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Container Benefits</title><link>https://cloud.layer5.io/academy/learning-paths/aabid/aabids-kubernetes-courcew/containers/content/container-benefits/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cloud.layer5.io/academy/learning-paths/aabid/aabids-kubernetes-courcew/containers/content/container-benefits/</guid><description>&lt;div class="chapter-content">

&lt;ol>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>dev and ops separation of concerns&lt;/strong> create application container images at build/release time rather than deployment time, thereby decoupling applications from infrastructure&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>

&lt;li>&lt;strong>continuous development, integration, and deployment&lt;/strong> provides for reliable and frequent container image build and deployment with quick and efficient rollbacks – due to image immutability&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>

&lt;/div>
&lt;h2 class="chapter-sub-heading">Traditional Deployment&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Early on, organizations ran applications on physical servers. There was no way to define resource boundaries for applications in a physical server, and this caused resource allocation issues. For example, if multiple applications run on a physical server, there can be instances where one application would take up most of the resources, and as a result, the other applications would underperform. A solution for this would be to run each application on a different physical server. But this did not scale as resources were underutilized, and it was expensive for organizations to maintain many physical servers.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
