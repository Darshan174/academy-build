&lt;p>Cloud storage is a service that provides a convenient and scalable solution for storing, backing up, and accessing data over the Internet, eliminating the need for physical storage devices like hard drives or USB sticks.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It is a form of secondary storage where users can save their files on remote servers managed by cloud storage providers. These providers offer various storage plans and features designed to meet diverse user requirements, allowing for easy storage capacity expansion and accessibility from any location with an Internet connection.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
