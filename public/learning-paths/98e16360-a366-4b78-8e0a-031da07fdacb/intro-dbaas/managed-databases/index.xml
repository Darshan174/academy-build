&lt;p>Is running a data center your core business? If the answer to this question is yes, you will have a different opinion and see managed databases in a different light. But the majority here will probably answer with no, and then a common view will open regarding the entry question.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>It is like with utilities. Do you run a wind farm or a hydroelectric power plant to produce your needed electricity? Or do you rely on a managed service from a utility provider? Information Technology (IT) services have become a utility for many areas anyway. So, specialists are defining and often dominating the market. Use those specialists to become a better specialist in your field of expertise.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Managed Databases</title><link>https://cloud.layer5.io/academy/learning-paths/98e16360-a366-4b78-8e0a-031da07fdacb/intro-dbaas/managed-databases/content/managed-db/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cloud.layer5.io/academy/learning-paths/98e16360-a366-4b78-8e0a-031da07fdacb/intro-dbaas/managed-databases/content/managed-db/</guid><description>&lt;h3 id="managed-databases" class="heading-link">

&lt;p>Looking at managed databases specifically, we see the benefits of simplifying the tasks associated with provisioning and maintaining a database. However, it is still likely that you need some level of experience working with databases to interact with them as you build and scale your app.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Suppose we do such evaluations in the context of IT services and factor in moving traditional data center services to the cloud. In that case, two trendy acronyms pop up immediately, CAPEX and OPEX.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Evolution of Data Services</title><link>https://cloud.layer5.io/academy/learning-paths/98e16360-a366-4b78-8e0a-031da07fdacb/intro-dbaas/managed-databases/content/evolution/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cloud.layer5.io/academy/learning-paths/98e16360-a366-4b78-8e0a-031da07fdacb/intro-dbaas/managed-databases/content/evolution/</guid><description>&lt;h3 id="evolution-of-data-services" class="heading-link">

&lt;p>There is a rapidly increasing popularity of managed data services, and many companies are on the lookout to find the most fitting service for the tasks at hand. So, not over stressing running a data center but still trying to drive this essential message home. Questions like:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>How many servers do I need?&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Do I have to cluster my services?&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Which database do I need?&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Do I need more than one database technology?&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>The questions can go on and on; thinking about them and solving them can easily cause bad headaches. So, finally, it comes down to an easy decision on the question: &amp;ldquo;Self-Hosted vs Managed?&amp;rdquo; And if you are not in the hosting business, you&amp;rsquo;re set and done.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
