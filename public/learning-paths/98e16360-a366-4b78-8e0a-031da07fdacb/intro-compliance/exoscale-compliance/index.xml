&lt;p>&lt;em>Information Security Management specifies a set of requirements that helps organizations manage their assets&amp;rsquo; security.&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>ISO 27001 is a globally recognized standard for information security management. It provides a framework for managing and protecting sensitive information assets like customer data, financial information, and intellectual property. The standard outlines a systematic approach to managing information security risks, including risk assessment, risk treatment, and continuous monitoring and improvement. Organizations that implement ISO 27001 can demonstrate to customers, partners, and regulators that they have a robust information security management system in place. The standard covers many security controls, including physical security, access controls, network security, and incident management.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
