&lt;p>Cloud-native refers to a software development approach that leverages cloud computing services and infrastructure to build and deploy applications. It involves designing applications as a collection of microservices that can run independently and scale dynamically, using containerization and orchestration technologies like Kubernetes.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Cloud-native applications are built to be resilient, scalable, and highly available and are often deployed using automated continuous delivery pipelines.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>DevOps is a software development methodology emphasizing collaboration and communication between development and operations teams to streamline the software development lifecycle. It involves automating and integrating processes across the entire software delivery pipeline, from development and testing to deployment and monitoring. DevOps aims to deliver software faster, with higher quality and reliability, by breaking down silos between teams and fostering a culture of continuous improvement and feedback.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Continuous Delivery</title><link>https://cloud.layer5.io/academy/learning-paths/98e16360-a366-4b78-8e0a-031da07fdacb/starter/cloud-native/content/continuous/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cloud.layer5.io/academy/learning-paths/98e16360-a366-4b78-8e0a-031da07fdacb/starter/cloud-native/content/continuous/</guid><description>&lt;h3 id="explained" class="heading-link">

&lt;p>Continuous Delivery is a software development practice where code changes are automatically built, tested, and deployed to production safely and reliably, with minimal human intervention.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It aims to deliver software updates frequently and consistently, allowing organizations to respond quickly to changing market needs and customer feedback.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Continuous Delivery is a powerful approach to software development that can help businesses achieve greater agility, efficiency, and quality in their software delivery process. By automating the build, test, and deployment process, developers can focus on writing code and delivering new features rather than spending time on manual processes. Additionally, Continuous Delivery can help to improve software quality by catching errors and bugs early in the development process before they can cause problems in production. However, there are also some potential challenges to implementing Continuous Delivery.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Container</title><link>https://cloud.layer5.io/academy/learning-paths/98e16360-a366-4b78-8e0a-031da07fdacb/starter/cloud-native/content/container/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cloud.layer5.io/academy/learning-paths/98e16360-a366-4b78-8e0a-031da07fdacb/starter/cloud-native/content/container/</guid><description>&lt;h3 id="explained" class="heading-link">

&lt;/div>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Containers are lightweight, portable, and self-contained software packages that include all the necessary components to run an application, such as code, libraries, and dependencies.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Containers are isolated from the host operating system and other containers, allowing applications to run consistently across different environments and platforms. They are often used in cloud computing and DevOps environments to simplify application deployment, scaling, and management.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Microservices</title><link>https://cloud.layer5.io/academy/learning-paths/98e16360-a366-4b78-8e0a-031da07fdacb/starter/cloud-native/content/microservices/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cloud.layer5.io/academy/learning-paths/98e16360-a366-4b78-8e0a-031da07fdacb/starter/cloud-native/content/microservices/</guid><description>&lt;h3 id="explained" class="heading-link">

&lt;/div>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Microservice architecture is a software development approach that structures an application as a collection of small, independent, and loosely coupled services.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Each service is designed to perform a specific business function and communicates with other services through well-defined APIs. Microservices are typically deployed independently and can be scaled individually, allowing for greater flexibility and agility in software development. The microservice architecture emphasizes modularity, resilience, and fault tolerance and is often used in cloud-native and DevOps environments.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
